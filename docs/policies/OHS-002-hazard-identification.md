# OHS-002: Hazard Identification

**Document ID:** OHS-002  
**Version:** 1.0  
**ISO Standard:** ISO 45001:2018 (Clause 6.1.2)

## Purpose
Systematic process to identify workplace hazards before they cause harm.

## Hazard Categories
1. **Physical**: Weather, marine conditions, equipment
2. **Biological**: Marine life, infectious diseases
3. **Chemical**: Fuel, cleaning products
4. **Ergonomic**: Manual handling, repetitive tasks
5. **Psychosocial**: Work stress, fatigue

## Identification Methods
- Pre-trip risk assessments
- Workplace inspections (monthly)
- Incident/near-miss analysis
- Worker reports
- Job hazard analysis

## Risk Matrix
- **Likelihood**: Rare (1), Unlikely (2), Possible (3), Likely (4), Almost Certain (5)
- **Consequence**: Insignificant (1), Minor (2), Moderate (3), Major (4), Catastrophic (5)
- **Risk Level** = Likelihood × Consequence

Risk Levels:
- 1-5: Low (Accept with monitoring)
- 6-12: Medium (Implement controls)
- 15-25: High (Immediate action required)

## Control Hierarchy
1. Elimination
2. Substitution
3. Engineering controls
4. Administrative controls
5. Personal protective equipment

## Review Frequency
- New activities: Before start
- Existing activities: Annual
- After incidents: Immediate
- Process changes: Before implementation
